This is Doctor app created using Flutter Node.js and Mongo db
To start app do the next steps:
1 Open new terminal and run command flutter run
2 To start our back-end move to server folder open integrated terminal run command npm install, than run
node index.js

Because of my machine specifications I was not able to complitely finish the task
currently only login and redirecting to home page works

The goal was to add jwt so we can authorize if user is loged in correctly.
Also data on home screen is currently static but idea was to create Colection in db with Patient info which would contain propertie called patientForToday and patientForTomorrow which would be boolean values based on which we would know in which category patient belongs and our representation would like as per
requested.
More to be done was to separate our components and make them more useable.
Also I could make more commits inside my project so it would be easir to understand and follow code.
